We are a group  focusing  on trans-disciplinary   Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Our group’s research encircles methodologies and applications of artificial intelligence; particularly in areas of Bayesian deep learning, climate extremes, geoscientific models, and mineral exploration. Our focus is in developing innovative machine learning methods inspired by technologies that include transfer learning, modular knowledge development, and multi-task learning. Our key strength is in the development of novel deep learning software frameworks with focus on uncertainty quantification in decision making. This year, we are moving into the area of vaccine testing research using deep learning methods.
